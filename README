### Maintainable JavaScript

#### Get started

First checkout the code:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:abruzzi/tw-testable-javascript.git
```

and initialize the environment:

```sh
cd tw-testable-javascript
bower install
```

once the installation is finished, you should change the `backend` API endpoint to:

```json
url: 'http://localhost:9292/locations'
```

to the real one.

#### Launch the app

Once you have done the previous steps, you can run the server by:

```sh
./server.sh
```

If everything goes well, you can see some location information in the console of the brower if you 
open `http://localhost:9999/`.
